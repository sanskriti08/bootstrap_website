        <br>
    <p> At Ming's Diner, we aim to source our ingredients directly from the country of origin, so that you can enjoy an authentic Thai culinary experience in a space that has all the ambience of a fine dining restaurant in Thailand. With hand carved statues, wooden masks and artefacts, as well as a life sized Buddha to bestow you with auspicious blessings as you enter. You can take a seat in the main dining room or opt for a more intimate sunken table secluded behind hand carved wooden screens. Coupled with our genuine hospitality for a memorable dining experience.
